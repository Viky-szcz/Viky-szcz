## Hi there 👋

### Cytometry in R Course starter questions

-Location: Hannover, Lower Saxony, Germany
-Weather: too cooooold
-My Favourite Fluorophore: BUV395
-Previous coding experience: My PI isn't reading this? Is he? Played a bit around in my master thesis with R still wondering why and how the code worked 
-What you hope to get from this course: A better understanding how a code works and playing around with what I learned on my 20+ colour spectra-Panels ;D

## Thanks for reading!
